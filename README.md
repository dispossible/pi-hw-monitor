# Raspberry Pi Hardware Monitor

This is a fairly simple hardware / task manager UI that I wrote to run on my headless Pi.

I haven't tested this but I expect this will run passably well on any system on any OS.

## Compatablity

Node v11: As I am running a Pi 2B I am running v11 of Node, which was the last version with support for Armv6.

For the frontend code I have used modern JS code in the scripting so will require a modern browser.

## Disclamer

I wrote this in an evening for my own personal use, the code is very simple and doesn't have much in the way of error handling or checking.
I have also done no testing outside of running it on my own Pi and viewing the UI on my Windows PC in Chrome.
